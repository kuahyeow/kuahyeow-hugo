It was a great pleasure to give a talk at Rubyconf Australia 2016 in Gold Coast.

My talk was about the cultural learnings of code review, as practised in Powershop.

The conference itself was awesome, the organisers really went out of their way to feel welcome and happy. The speakers,
for example were treated to a early morning breakfasts with Dolphins ! The closing party at MovieWorld was brilliant too -
 outdoor dinner with heaps of yummy food and we got part of the park all to ourselves.

Here is the
