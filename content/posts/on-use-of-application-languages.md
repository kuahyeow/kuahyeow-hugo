There seems to be quite an explosion of demand in more powerful websites equipped with server capabilities using scripts like <a href="http://weblogs.mozillazine.org/roadmap/archives/008325.html">JavaScript</a>, PHP, and Perl, having been involved with a couple of PHP companies. However, I have always viewed this as "lightweight" languages, compared to Java or C++ which can be used for files and system programming as well. Of course, the lines are becoming blur as web languages introduce more "heavyweight" features like classes (e.g. <a href="http://nz.php.net/manual/en/language.oop5.php">PHP 5</a>).<br /><br />Now, what's lightweight and what's heavyweight?
