Strange to start a blog at the end :P But yeah, should have started a blog at the start of holidays, not the end. It's amazing how two weeks can just fly by. Sleep, wake, sleep....<br /><br />Now I think it's time to finish up my assignments! Third year assignments are definitely more worthwhile in the sense that I learn something from it.
