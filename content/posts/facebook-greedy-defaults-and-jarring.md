Commited Facebook Suicide for the second time. Where do I start? ...<br />
<br /><br />
<br />The first thing that jarred me was that my full birthday is published. This in combination with search engine visibility means that it's spammer time.<br />
<br /><br />
<br />Next thing that happened is that the privacy settings had "Everyone", "Friends of Friends", and "Friends". Nice and simple, I thought. But no, I have to exclude my full birthday again from everyone. (I know about how your friend's applications can just mine everyone's data through friends).<br />
<br /><br />
<br />Ok, I'll just <em>configure</em> that again.<br />
<br /><br />
<br />What do I see next. Social <strong>Ads</strong>. Ads. Default On. In my name. I hate Ads that purport to be in my name. That's it. Goodbye.<br />
