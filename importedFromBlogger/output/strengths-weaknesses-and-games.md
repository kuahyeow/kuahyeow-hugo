Increase your strong attributes up to insane levels. Weaker attributes would be increased only for the sake of 'balance'.&amp;nbsp; To translate into gamer-speak: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Helvetica Neue&amp;quot;,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;Level up all magic skills for the mage, and have some combat skills to keep up with the group. Increase the tank's combat and defense skills to insane, and increase healing and magic if there's a chance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Balance is important as weaknesses cannot be so abysmally weak that you cannot function if a team member which has that strength was unavailable. In gamer-speak again:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Helvetica Neue&amp;quot;,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;Tank has to be able to self-heal and revive mage if mage goes down, and hang on until mage revives and heals group.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Imagine instead we concentrate on improving weakness more than improving strengths. What would result is a group that has similar strengths and weakness, i.e. a homogeneous group, but at levels lower than peak strengths. This team of 'all-rounders' would then be able to do each other's jobs, but none would available to handle particularly &lt;i&gt;difficult&lt;/i&gt; problems. In game-land, this is referred to as:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Helvetica Neue&amp;quot;,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;Boss kills mediocre party in one stroke.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Whereas a team with people who has different and fully-developed skills will have a better chance of tackling the problem. In game-land, this scenario is better:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;Helvetica Neue&amp;quot;,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;Boss unleashes stroke of hell, tank survives and manages to revive others. Or Mage casts protective spell powerful enough to protect party.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Which brings us to complementary strengths. The team must have a variety of different strengths to deal with different problems that crop up. This, ideally should be addressed when you are starting to hire for the team. Of course it's hard to figure out strengths in an interview.
