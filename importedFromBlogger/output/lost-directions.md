They gave a map and directions to nowhere! If you notice the picture, Broomhill Road is a dead end.

It doesn't lead to Highbury Road or Highbury Crescent or whatever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note to self: Mt Pleasant Rd is not so pleasant after all. How do those ppl live and drive there? It's a horror to drive there.....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I sent an email to Wises.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My letter to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wises.co.nz&quot;&gt;wises.co.nz&lt;/a&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Hi,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you kindly click at the link at the bottom of this email, you will find a most horrendous mistake! I had to make it to Highbury in Wellington having never been there, but the directions are wrong!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In particular: there is no connection between Broomhill Road to Highbury Crescent! I drove to three dead ends without ever coming near my destination.
