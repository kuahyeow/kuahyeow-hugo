<br />
<br />Can you believe this? Althought his nick is <em>cheesy</em>, his writing is just superb. I quote:
<br />
<br />"...And yet, there is my son with Shmi in his eyes -- a product of love, before the storm. He is no Jedi, for his passion blows too hot, but perhaps he is not Sith, either. He is an instrument of change. He is the catalyst at the centre, the fulcrum on which pivot fates. To see him is to be blinded by the glory of the Force that orbits him like living netting."

<br />No Jedi, but not Sith either....Absolutely stunning.
